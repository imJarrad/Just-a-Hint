We get it, you’ve been up since the crack of dawn. You’re staring at your screen, trying desperately to get that coveted green row of letters. 

What the heck could it be!??
I’ve normally figured it out by now!
I can’t let Aunty Margaret beat me again… 

You’ve pored over dictionaries, thesauruses, and even that weird, dusty Scrabble book your Grandma had.

And STILL, you just can’t get it. 

Well, we have the answer, and we’re you’re friends, so we wrote you a hint for today’s Wordle.
Not the answer! just a hint. 

Ready?<br /><br />

Our Hint for the Wordle on Wednesday, 22 March 2023:

**Cozy cover for a good night's sleep, or a secret hiding spot?**

<br /><br /><br />*More Facts:*

Today's Wordle is game number 641.

Word Class: noun nouns so far this year: 42 

On this day last year, the Wordle answer was slosh. Remember that? 

Now it's time for everyone's favorite section – the Bad Dad Joke of the Day:<br /><br />Why did the pillow think the cozy cover was a secret hiding spot? Because it wanted to keep its dreams safe from prying eyes! 

Ok, we'll see you again tomorrow,
